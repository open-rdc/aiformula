#### Acquirable dataï¼š
* camera data
* odometry data

You can control the mobility of the simulator topic: `/cmd_vel`

### Running Example
To start simulator:
  ```bash
  ros2 launch simulator gazebo_simulator.launch.py
  ```

### If you want to use a gamepad in the simulator
- To start `joy.launch.py` and `teleop.launch.py` in launchers package.
- Remapping in `teleop.launch.py`\
`/aiformula_control/handle_controller/cmd_vel` -> `cmd_vel`
  


### It takes a long time (about two and a half minutes) only when launching gazebo_simulator.launch.py `for the first time` !
- Once the world file is loaded into gazebo, it is cached under `~/.gazebo/model`
- After the second time, it does not take long because the cache can be used.
